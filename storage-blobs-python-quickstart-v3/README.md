# How to run this project

## Prerequisites

To complete this quickstart: 

* Install [Azure Storage SDK for Python](https://github.com/Azure/azure-storage-python).
<!-- (https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/develop/python/)
which makes it easy to consume Microsoft Azure Storage services.  -->

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.

## Create a storage account using the Azure portal

First, create a new general-purpose storage account to use for this quickstart. 

1. Go to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and log in using your Azure account. 
2. On the Hub menu, select **New** > **Storage** > **Storage account - blob, file, table, queue**. 
3. Enter a name for your storage account. The name must be between 3 and 24 characters in length and may contain numbers and lowercase letters only. It must also be unique.
4. Set `Deployment model` to **Resource manager**.
5. Set `Account kind` to **General purpose**.
6. Set `Performance` to **Standard**. 
7. Set `Replication` to **Locally Redundant storage (LRS)**.
8. Set `Storage service encryption` to **Disabled**.
9. Set `Secure transfer required` to **Disabled**.
10. Select your subscription. 
11. For `resource group`, create a new one and give it a unique name. 
12. Select the `Location` to use for your storage account.
13. Check **Pin to dashboard** and click **Create** to create your storage account. 

After your storage account is created, it is pinned to the dashboard. Click on it to open it. Under SETTINGS, click **Access keys**. Select a key and copy the CONNECTION STRING to the clipboard, then paste it into Notepad for later use.

## Configure your storage connection string
In the application, you must provide your storage account name and account key to create a BlockBlobService object. Open the `example.py` file from the Solution Explorer in your IDE. Replace **accountname** and **accountkey** with your account name and key. 

```python
block_blob_service = BlockBlobService(account_name='accountname', account_key='accountkey')
```
